  * dock: Sync theme with upstream d2d fixes.
    This includes fixes coming from:
     - https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock/pull/1826
     - https://github.com/micheleg/dash-to-dock/pull/1827
    And more importantly:
     - Increase apps tooltips margins
     - Set margin for default app-running dots
     - Remove upstream defined dash-item-container's children margin
       (LP: #1966167)
     - Do not add edge padding to edge elements
     - Fix definition for dash-separator in shrink mode
     - Take in account side margin and opposite padding in separators
     - Explicitly use border radius and spacing from upstream
     - Simplify dash separator definition based on upstream one
     - Use unique function to handle padding/margin on internal children
     - avoid computing the shrunk dash padding multiple times
     - Use generic style generator for shrink mode too
     - Move mixins to the top of the file for easier re-usage
     - Use dock-container-style to define the extended cases too
     - Support shrink and position-based style for labels
     - Move dock specific variables to dock namespace
     - Sync global variable definitions with upstream

    This reverts commit 0d5afaf3d4a785f16d27d0b4607f83ae96ba73f6.
  * meson: Import modules once
  * Revert commit that adds color flawors...
  * Revert "use deafult's gtk-2.0 for build to pass"
    This reverts commit 0e5162f5c73b1e6fb915e2968e0e42ec6047f830.
  * meson: Remove uneeded symlinks and use build system to pick files
    Make meson to re-use default theme thdefinitions and assets when a theme
    doesn't provide a specific version for it.
    As per this we can avoid having multiple symlinks but just ensuring
    that we always prefer theme-specific files, and in case they don't exist
    we fallback to the same theme variant or to the default theme.
    As per this, we can avoid lots of duplication and symlinks that are not
    easiest to maintain.
    One note on sassc: it will now include multiple paths from where to pick
    a specific included resource.
    Note that if "@include 'fooo'" is used in a sym-linked resource it will
    try to load that from the parent folder of the sym-link target resides.
    So, we still need to preserve some symlinks otherwise sassc will just
    try to load everything from the target folder.
    In case a file needs to be overridden by a theme, ensure that it's going
    to be loaded (`strace` is your friend).
  * gtk/meson: Auto-generate gtk-themes for accent colors.
    Use some scss magic to create accent color themes without having us to
    re-create or re-define all the themes.
    We use an accent-colors scss file as entry point that may define the
    yaru variables for accent colors and then we load the standard themes.
    In case such variables are defined, the accents are set.
  * gnome-shell: Use SCSS to compute the final icon URI.
    Depending on the theme we want to use we may need to load different
    assets, so replace the "url" function so that we can dynamically update
    the returned value depending on the theme.
  * gtksourceview: Generate theme files just once without overwriting
  * gnome-shell: Generate colored assets based on accent color.
    Make some "dummy" assets that can be used to generate svg with replaced
    colors, and use them for the GNOME Shell theme.
  * gnome-shell: sync checkradio bg color with other themes
  * gnome-shell: Do not use sub-folder hacks to install renamed generated files.
    From an hack to another, but at least it only uses almost only meson and
    it doesn't require to modify the file system for further variants.
  * meson: Look for sassc just once.
    No need to repeat the same operation for all the components
  * common: Add some sass string utils to a common place, and use it for shell
  * gnome-shell: Always use variant-named assets in all the variants.
    Since we now may have multiple variants of the same assets, we need to
    be sure of what is what and do not assume that the dark theme variant is
    the default one.
    So let's wrap our 'url' function override so that it always include the
    theme variant suffix on the colorable assets, and add it when generating
    the theme.
    This will make easier to switch from light to dark as default variant.
  * gnome-shell: Ensure that the default variant is light (in sync with gtk)
    GNOME shell will be now capable of switching theme variant, so we can
    safely use dark/light variants accordingly.
  * gnome-shell: Add support for generating themes with accent colors
  * CI: Also run tests during build.
    Now that we have it...
  * debian/rules: Disable sessions installation using configure options
  * meson: Bump dependency on meson 0.58.
    Keeping compatibility with such old version doesn't make sense, given
    that newer meson can always installed from pip
  * render-bitmaps: Support running from other CWD's
  * icons: Add meson targets to automatically render bitmaps.
    Instead of going through the manual scripts now it's possible to just
    use meson to render the icons.
    A new target called `render-icons` is provided, plus more for each
    variant (such as `render-icons-default`) that can be run just using
    `ninja` or `meson compile`.
    In order to support this, now render-bitmaps supports input/output
    folders as parameters.
  * icons: Generate symlinks as part of icon rendering target.
    We can generate symlinks as well once the rendering is done, to have
    all in one step
  * icons: Regenerate symlinks for Yaru default theme
  * icons: Add support for generating icons with accent colors.
    We use the accent-colors computed through the GTK logic to re-color our
    SVG.
    Add targets to easily generate the icons, so that we don't have to
    handle the complex generation manually.
  * icons: Generate index.theme files at configure stage if not any.
    The update operation is quick enough that there's no need to define an
    extra step for it during icons rendering
  * icons: Generate assets for Yaru accent colors.
    All thanks to ninja -C _build -v render-accented-icons
  * icons: Generate icons for sage and prussian green variants
  * gnome-shell: Expose default gdm and shell variants on configure options.
    And also default on dark variant on gdm, while we use light for the
    shell.

  * Add desktop-logoff sound.
    When the sounds were added, the logoff one wasn't. @madsrh says
    this was because it'd be better to just log off immediately, and not
    wait for a sound to play.
    Session managers can handle this stuff, and play the sound
    while logging off in the background. But if it doesn't work, the
    sound can always be disabled.
