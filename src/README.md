## Source Files

Do not edit icon assets directly (i.e. tweaking those in the "Suru" folder with a raster editor)! For ease of development and organization's sake, the sources for all the different icons and cursors are kept in various subfolders: 

 - [fullcolor](./fullcolor) contains the source files and render scripts for all full-color icons.
 - [symbolic](./symbolic) contains the source files and render scripts for all symbolic icons.
 - [cursors](./cursors) contains the source files and render scripts for the cursor theme.
 - [symlinks](./symlinks) contains the data lits and generation scripts to create symbolic links the icon theme.

## Resources

**[Suru.gpl](./Suru.gpl)**
- The Inkscape colour palette for the Suru icons. You can copy it to `.config/inkscape/palettes` and restart Inkscape to able to choose it from the palette menu (in the lower right corner).
